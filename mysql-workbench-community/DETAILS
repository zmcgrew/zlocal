cat << EOF
MySQL Workbench enables a DBA, developer, or data architect to visually design,
model, generate, and manage databases. It includes everything a data modeler
needs for creating complex ER models, forward and reverse engineering, and also
delivers key features for performing difficult change management and
documentation tasks that normally require much time and effort.
